## What would I improve if I had more time

- Input Validation:

Could have enhance input validation by using a more comprehensive validation library such as express-validator. Like for checking if the ids etc are in the correct format.

- Better Endpoint descriptions.
I would have added description on top of each route on what with route requires and whats the purpoes. Maybe would have used bodyParams in the POST route for better readibility. 

- Better Types and Models:
I would have converted the code to typescript and would have added Models to have a proper schema for each entity.

- More Unit Tests:
Would have written more detailed tests for all Contollers


- Error Handling Improvement:

Would have added better and meaningful errors for each endpoint.

- Create Sdk

I would have created an sdk on top of the api for easier access on the front end side without the need of entering the endpoints and better level of abstraction.
